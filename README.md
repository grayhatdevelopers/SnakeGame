# SnakeGame
A (very) quick and dirty Snake game implementation, in GLUT C++

Welcome to my first and highly inefficient programming project!

HOW TO PLAY:
1. Install libraries again using "bash install-libraries.sh", even if you have done so before, as the libraries have been slightly altered.
2. Run "make"
3. Run "./game-release"
4. Enjoy the game!


BUILD 4.0:
-Updated Level 2
-Integrated savegame.txt, now player can save and resume game even after closing the application
-Updated GUI



toDo:
-savegame.txt does not store position of tail hence makes it easy to cheat
-Failure to create Level 3 with multiplayer mode (Insert COIN refers to Level Code 3)
